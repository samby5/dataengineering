-- Although we can add Clustred index on the crsCode column to speed up performance, I would rather prefer CI on the composite key and NCI on crscode to address this query . Add a clustered index  on  columns studId and crsCode. Here 2 cols are predfered as the transcript table is uniquely identified by studId and crsCode cols
--add add NCI on crsCode which speeds up performance - No of rows read = 2
